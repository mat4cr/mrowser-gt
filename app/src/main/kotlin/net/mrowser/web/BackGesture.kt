/**
 * Pure decision table for the BACK key's tap-versus-hold gesture.
 *
 * BACK is the most-used key on a TV remote and carries several meanings (exit
 * fullscreen / close the bar / page back / close the tab), so the routing lives
 * here where it can be tested on the JVM. [CursorLayout] owns the Handler, the
 * `backDown` / `backLongPressed` flags and the actual BACK chain; it only applies
 * the [Decision] this returns.
 *
 * The key action arrives as a raw Int (`android.view.KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN` == 0,
 * `ACTION_UP` == 1) so this module stays free of Android imports.
